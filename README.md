# Reinforcement Learning Project : Self Parking Car

### Environment : Parking-V0 from Highway-Env
Highway-env is a collection of environments for autonomous driving and tactical decision-making tasks, developed and maintained by Edouard Leurent. The Parking environment is a goal-conditioned continuous control task in which the ego-vehicle must park in a given space with the appropriate heading.

### Agent : DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) Agent
This model-free policy-based reinforcement learning agent is optimized directly by gradient ascent. It uses Hindsight Experience Replay to efficiently learn how to solve a goal-conditioned task.



### -> pre-trained agent is included in this repo for demonstration purposes : 'pre-trained-DDPG-HER.h5f'
